AnthropicProvider_claude-3-opus-latest,Show me the guide page that labels the implant's key parts.,"The image in Figure 2 labels the key parts of the patient-specific glenoid guide implant:

1. Central Drill Cylinder: Facilitates the planned center hole drilling when using the appropriate pilot wire.
2. Push or Directional Handle: Provides haptic or ""sensorial touch"" feedback and guide seating stability.
3. Coracoid Clip: Grips onto the base of coracoid.
4. Patient Specific Guide Identifier: Alphanumeric code that links the guide to the patient case.
5. Labrum Offset: Bridges between the coracoid clip and the lateral body of the guide to prevent soft tissue interference at the anterior-superior border of the glenoid surface.
6. 2.0mm K-wire Hole: Provides the option to pin a 2.0mm K-wire for added guide stability during drilling.
